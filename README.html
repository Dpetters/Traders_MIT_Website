INSTALLATION

IMPORTANT: If you are setting this up on windows, read the WINDOWS INSTALLATION PREP section below

1. Create a python virtual environment using virtualenv named TRADERS by running “virtualenv --no-site-packages TRADERS”
2. For convenience, create aliases such as the following in .bash_profile "alias td='cd $TRADERS_AT_MIT_WEBSITE'" and "alias us='source $TRADERS_AT_MIT_VIRTUALENV/bin/activate'". This way you can just run “td” “ts” and be in the project root ready to go.
3. Once you have the environment activated (by running “us”), run "pip install –r requirements.txt" from the project root.
4. Create a copy of settings_local_template.py in the project root and name it settings_local.py
5. Open settings_local.py and add a tuple (“Your name”, “your email”) to ADMINS.
10. Run “fab create_database”.
11. Run “python manage.py runcserver”
12. Go to localhost:8000. You’re set!


WINDOWS INSTALLATION PREP

1. If you do not have git installed, then install msysgit and add its bin as well as the mingw's bin folders to the path. Create HOME environment variable pointing to home directory.
2. Install setuptools
